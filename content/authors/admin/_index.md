## About Me

I am a researcher in the Crypto group at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. My research interest lies broadly in Theoretical Computer Science and Cryptography. More specifically, I am working on designing efficient algorithms for learning and testing functions over the Hamming Cube. Recently, I have been focusing on problems related to designing cryptographic primitives in the presence of stronger real-world adversaries such as leakage, subversion, and trojans.
