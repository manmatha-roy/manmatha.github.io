## About Me
I am a researcher at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, where I am also pursuing a PhD under the joint supervision of Prof. [Subhamoy Maitra](https://isi.irins.org/profile/61161) and Dr. [Arijit Ghosh](https://sites.google.com/site/homepagearijitghosh/). My research interests are in Theoretical Computer Science, with a focus on Boolean-valued functions over discrete algebraic structures. I investigate their structural properties and develop efficient algorithms for learning and testing these functions, with applications to cryptography, coding theory, and learning theory.
